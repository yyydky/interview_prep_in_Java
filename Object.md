1. Abstract
- An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€”it may or may not include abstract methods. 
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. 
- When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class.
- They need to be inherited, so no Final.

2. Abstract vs. Concrete
- Can't have an abstract method in a concrete class.

3. Abstract vs. Interface
